        <p>
          CoWoof is a community of dog lovers who are committed to helping each other out. We believe that no dog owner should have to go through the stress of finding a last-minute dog sitter or walker when their schedule gets hectic. That's why we created CoWoof, a platform where dog owners can connect with each other and help each other out.
